# GSAP_Animation
These are examples of Greensock's Animation Platform. You will find several small projects that allow you to experiment with GSAP.

I'm hoping that you will take a look at all the features that GSAP has to offer. 

You can find them here. http://greensock.com

If you are having trouble with ScrambleText, just rmember it is a paid feature, and you need to be a member to get the file needed to use it.
