# GSAP_Animation
These are examples of Greensock's Animation Platform. You will find several small projects that allow you to experiment with GSAP.

I'm hoping that you will take a look at all the features that GSAP has to offer. 

You can find them here. http://greensock.com

If you are having trouble with the ScrambleText, just rmember they are paid features and you need to be a member to get the scripts needed to use them.
